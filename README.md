This repository contains a report about my reflection from working on a Continuous Integration project with other group members online. 
Please read the document called Hwang_Louis_report.pdf to get a reflection on what I learned from completing this project.

Most of the code could not be shared since the functions written must be kept confidential, but some of the unit tests that I wrote 
for this project can be seen in the Python file included.
